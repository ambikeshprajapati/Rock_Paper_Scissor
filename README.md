# Rock_Paper_Scissor
Rock paper scissor is a popular game. 
In this project I made the rock paper scissor game using python 3 in visual studio code.
The user has to play against the computer which makes it choice randomly.
The random module is used to generate random numbers.
This is a simple project with just few lines of code.
